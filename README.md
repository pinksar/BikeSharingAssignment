# Project Name
> A bike sharing project which uses linear regression method for predicting the demand of shared bikes.

## Table of Contents
* Visualizing dataset and applying Ordinary least square method to find best fit line
* Python 3.0, Seabron, Sklearn, statsmodel, Numpy and Pandas libraries
* Prediction using final model

## General Information
- Project predicts the variables most affecting the demand of shared bikes
- Multiple Linear regression model developed using plotting and machine learning libraries
- Project forms a linear model based on train-test set to predict the demand 
- Dataset in excel form containts two year data starting from 2018 to 2019
- Project follows the assumption of linear regression

## Conclusions
- Temperature is concluded as the most affecting variable for demand rise
- It is seen that yearly the demand rises by a double factor
- Few or partly clouds or clear skies is the most favourable weather 
- High demand in order was seen in fall
- 

## Technologies Used
- library - Python 3.0
- library - Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Sklearn
